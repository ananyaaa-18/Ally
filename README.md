## ｡ ₊°༺❤︎༻°₊ ｡ What Ally Is 
**Ally** is a simple and fun real-time chat web application built using **Firebase Realtime Database**.  
It allows users to create chat rooms, join them, and send messages instantly — all inside a clean, cute interface.  
The app is designed to help people connect and communicate seamlessly in real time.

## °❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･ Why I Made This Project
As a teenage girl who's struggled with social events and often felt lonely, I created this web-app with the intentions of creating a positive enviroment for the users. I made this project with the hopes that people would feel more comfortable and enthusiastic to use this app — a space where people can talk, share, and connect freely.  
Building Ally was also my way of learning how **Firebase** works with real-time data and improving my **JavaScript** and **web development** skills.

## ₊˚⊹♡ How I Built It
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend/Database:** Firebase Realtime Database  
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (main IDE) & Sublime Text (used it partly to test some codes)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages  

Ally uses Firebase to store and sync messages and chat rooms in real-time. Users can log in with their name, create or join rooms, and chat instantly with others.

## °⋆.ೃ࿔*:･☁️ Challenges and Learnings
Like any first real-world project, I ran into a few bumps:
- Setting up Firebase correctly and connecting it with my web app
- Fixing the *Content Security Policy* (CSP) issue that blocked Firebase functions
- Debugging why my rooms weren’t being added properly 😅  

But through these challenges, I learned a lot about:
- How **Firebase Realtime Database** works behind the scenes  
- The importance of **console debugging** and checking errors carefully  
- Writing cleaner, more organized JavaScript code

## 🗓️🌱🗒🖊 What's Next?
I plan to keep improving Ally by:
- Adding user authentication (sign-up & login)
- Enhancing the UI with emojis and themes
- Adding message timestamps and notifications
